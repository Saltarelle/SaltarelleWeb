This namespace implements the Web Audio API and is up to date as of 
the W3C Working Draft dated 13 December 2012.

Current version:
http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/

This version:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-webaudio-20121213/



This API is available in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari,
and Firefox natively, and can be polyfilled into other browsers via
the use of a Flash-based polyfill called WAAPISim.

Please note that Firefox had previously implemented an older draft
audio API, called Audio Data API, which was superseded by this
standardized API.
